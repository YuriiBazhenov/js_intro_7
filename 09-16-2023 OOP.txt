OOP

Everything around object

Prototypical Inheritance can be implemented in 3 ways in JS:
1. Constructor functions
2. Classes
3. Object create (not a best solution in terms of intuitiveness)

Getters and Setters: https://www.programiz.com/javascript/getter-setter


Classes can have:
- Constructor
- static or private properties

Inheritance
"Constructor functions" and use prototype to achieve inheritence
"Classes" can use extends keyword and super function to achieve inheritence
